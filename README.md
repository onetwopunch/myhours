The maximum amount of hours that a Trainee can accrue while still in his or her degree program is 1,300 hours, which breaks down as follows:


750 max counseling and supervision + all remaining hours categories = 1,300 max pre-degree hours


You need at least one hour of individual or two hours of group supervision in any week that you claim supervised work experience. 40 hours of work experience is the maximum amount of work experience that you can claim in a week, and five hours of work experience is the maximum amount of supervision you can claim towards work experience in a given week. You may need to gain additional hours of supervision per week in order to comply with your counseling experience to supervision ratio.
Starting January 1, 2010, MFT Interns working in a governmental entity, school, college/university, or an institution that is both nonprofit and charitable may obtain all supervision via videoconferencing.


### Counseling Experience-Supervision Ratio
In order to claim direct counseling experience (anything in category A above), you must obtain the proper amount of supervision. Depending on whether you are an MFT Trainee or a registered Intern, you must comply with different supervision requirements.

*NOTE:* For our purposes, a unit of supervision can be either one-hour of individual supervision or two hours of group supervision.
As an MFT Trainee, you must meet the mandatory minimum of one unit of supervision per week to count work experience in a work setting. 
Also, you will be required to obtain **one unit of supervision for every five hours of direct counseling experience** earned in each setting. 
As an MFT Intern, you must meet the mandatory minimum of **one unit of supervision per week to count work experience** in a work setting, 
and you need to obtain an **additional unit of supervision in any week in which you earn more than 10 hours** of direct counseling/psychotherapy hours in each work setting.
